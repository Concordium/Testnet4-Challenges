## Mission

**1) Setup a node**

- Run a node for a month (30 full calendar days).

- The 30 days count starts from 21-01-2021 at 08:00 CET, even if you started to run your node before that. Hence, if you have uninterrupted uptime, the challenge can earliest be completed on 20-02-2021 at 08:00 CET.

- If your node is down for some periods, you must add the lost time afterwards. The summary log accumulates the uptimes of the node. It must show a runtime of at least 720 hours when submitting.

- This challenge can be run concurrently with challenge OT4-B1 or as stand-alone challenge. It cannot be run concurrently with challenges OT4-B2 or OT4-B3.

- When the node is running, move on to the next phase.

**2) Baking (1 week)**

- Create an identity and account in the mobile app. Request the GTU drop (You will receive 2000 GTUs, even though the drop says 100 GTU.
