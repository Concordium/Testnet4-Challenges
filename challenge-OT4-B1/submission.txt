nodeid:3c2df8fb19fae684

**Note**: due to the test net glitch I had stop the node, extract minified logs, remove the full logs (my node had run out of storage due to the volume of warnings), and restart. 

The combined uptime is as required (`1157704 sec + 3020917 sec = 4178621 sec = ~1160 hours > 720 hours`). 

I'm attaching minified logs from the period before and after the restart.
