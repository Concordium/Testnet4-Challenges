nodeid:3c2df8fb19fae684

**Note**: due to the testnet glitch I had to stop the node, extract minified logs, remove the full logs (my node had run out of storage due to the large volume of warnings), and restart. 

The combined uptime is as required (`1157704 sec + 3020917 sec = 4178621 sec = ~1160 hours > 720 hours`). 

I'm attaching minified logs, along with system-info output, from the period before (`concordium-testnet-node-2096ed29e5b5bbae9ccedbf7511b055a4f5214c52820e7c3374daeaaab8021c8.log`) and after (`concordium-testnet-node-1dec3b5cf3a73462f8406c91e506c89d69fb1a7c614c55d0f7ba497a73ac8d04.log`) the restart.
