## Mission

- Run a node for a month (30 full calender days).

- The 30 days count starts from 21-01-2021 at 08:00 CET, even if you started to run your node before that. Hence, if you have uninterrupted uptime, the challenge can earliest be completed on 20-02-2021 at 08:00 CET.

- If your node is down for some periods, you must add the lost time afterwards. The summary log accumulates the uptimes of the node. It must show a runtime of at least 720 hours when submitting.

- This challenge can be run concurrently with either challenge OT4-B2, OT-B3 or OT4-B4 or as a stand-alone challenge. 


## Submission

- In submission.txt
  - Add your node ID
- Upload your summary log (see [Logs](/logs.md) for instructions & tooling)
  - Runtime must show >= 720 hours.
  - Do not temper with or change anything in the log. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee acceptance.

Please follow the [submission instructions](/submission-process.md) thoroughly - your submission will not be accepted otherwise.
