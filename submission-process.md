## Submission Process

1. Fork the Tesnet4-Challenges repo. ([howto](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo))
2. Each challenge has it's own folder, with a `readme.md` and `submission.txt` files.
  - Submissions must adhere to the `readme.md` instructions exactly or they will be automatically disqualified.
  - Submissions must fill out the `submission.txt` details or they will be automatically disqualified.
3. Create or upload your submission content in the correct challenge folder <ins>**only when you have completed it**</ins>. ([howto](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github))
4. Make a signed commit. ([howto](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification))
5. Create a pull request. ([howto](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests))

⚠️ Please make only **one PR for all submissions**<sup>*</sup> ⚠️

Repeat steps 3+4 for every additional challenge when completed. You can keep adding more commits to the same pull request.

Only make a challenge submission when it is completed. Do not submit placeholders or "reserve my spot" attempts - these will be ignored and may penalise your entire submission.

<sup><sup>*</sup>Yes, this is different from our advice in OT3.</sup>


## Disqualified Submissions

- Closed pull requests will not be evaluated. If you close your PR that means you're not participating and don't want to be reviewed.
- If a user has more than 1 pull request open, only the earliest will be evaluated and all others closed
- If a user is detected to create multiple Github accounts and make multiple submissions, all their submssions on all accounts will be disqualified.

Any behaviour indicating users acting in bad faith may result in disqualification at the Concordium teams' sole discretion.

## Submission Ordering

- If there are more submissions that seats for any particular challenge, we will evaluate ordering based on submission time for the submission.txt related to each specific challenge.
- Do not make dummy commits to "reserve your place", this will result in disqualification.
- Tampering with git commit times or git history in submissions will result in disqualification.




## Review process

- Once all challenges have completed, Concordium will start labelling PRs according to detected submissions, and reviewing them.
- PRs will receive a comment that either confirms or rejects the submission.
- When all challenges are reviewed, a summary table of all reviews, usernames and total rewards will be posted.
- There will be 7 days for any feedback/issue resolution.
- After this time the final rewards will be posted with no further appeal.

If we leave a comment asking for more information, or reject a submission, you can give us more info by commenting on the PR. There is no need to contact us or let us know outside of Github, we get notifications already.
