# Testnet 4 Challenges

We are really glad to invite you to join our Incentivized Testnet 4!

Concordium Testnet 4 was released January 13, 2021.

Concordium Testnet 4 Incentivized challenges start January 20, 2021 at 23:00 PT and will end 6 weeks later.

During this period, smart contract developers, businesses, node operators, and community members can, collectively, receive rewards up to 0,15% of the mainnet supply, (up to 15,000,000 GTU) for helping secure, sustain, and grow Concordium Network and the ecosystem. Rewards will be transferred in GTU after the Mainnet goes live.  

Concordium Testnet 4 is a collaborative era intended to stress-test the network, encourage participation from all over the world, and help testers, developers, and users get ready to participate in Concordium.

Each of the baker challenge OT4-B* takes 4 weeks to complete. OT4-B1 can be run as a stand-alone challenge or concurrently with <ins>**one of**</ins> either OT4-B2, OT-B3, or OT4-B4. OT4-B2, OT4-B3, and OT4-B4 **cannot** be combined with each other.

Each of the transaction challenge OT4-T* takes 1 week to complete. The transaction challenges can be run concurrently, i.e. they can be combined with each other.

The challenges intentionally only provide a minimum description of the tasks. For detailed step-to-step guides and troubleshooting, we expect contributors to consult [Documentation and Help](#documentation-and-help) or our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/xWmQ5tp).


## Rules of Engagement

- A contributor, who wants to submit a challenge result in this repository, must be a registered user on GitHub.
- Concordium accepts one approved submission per challenge per contributor, unless the challenges exclude one another, see [Missions and Challenges](#missions-and-challenges).
- The GitHub user name should not be changed until the rewards are paid out on mainnet.
- Each challenge has a GTU amount tag, which is rewarded, if Concordium accepts the submission.
- Each challenge has a total number of seats for which rewards can be paid out.
- All submissions must strictly follow our [Submission Process](/submission-process.md), otherwise they will be rejected.


Note: all GTU activity on the Testnet is non-transferrable to Mainnet, the Testnet is just that: a test network.
