# Testnet 4 Challenges

We are really glad to invite you to join our Incentivized Testnet 4!

Concordium Testnet 4 was released January 13, 2021.

Concoridum Testnet 4 Incentivized challenges start January 20, 2021 at 23:00 PT and will end 6 weeks later.

During this period, smart contract developers, businesses, node operators, and community members can, collectively, receive rewards up to 0,15% of the mainnet supply, (up to 15,000,000 GTU) for helping secure, sustain, and grow Concordium Network and the ecosystem. Rewards will be transferred in GTU after the Mainnet goes live.  

Concordium Testnet 4 is a collaborative era intended to stress-test the network, encourage participation from all over the world, and help testers, developers, and users get ready to participate in Concordium.
