## Challenge Format

The main challenges with a very generous limit of up to 750 seats are intended to stress-test the network and encourage participation from all over the world.
For the smart contract challenges, we have chosen a more exclusive approach with only 20 available seats.

Our main purpose for the smart contract challenges is to engage directly with experienced developers, get feedback on our framework, the relevant documentation, missing functionality or descriptions etc. and to start building a smart contract community for the Concordium blockchain.
We also aim to provide a forum where developers can work together on a high technical level.

The idea with OT4-SC1 - OT4-SC3 is that the same smart contract is used for all challenges and challenge rewards are cumulative depending on quality of work. Challenges OT4-SC1 and OT4-SC2 require active submissions according to the guidelines given. Challenge OT4-SC3 is an exceptional contribution bonus. It does not require submission. Our smart contract core team will assess all smart contracts submitted in OT4-SC2 and then select the Top5.

A contributor can apply for one of the 20 seats by sending a registration, which will be evaluated and accepted or rejected by the Concordium tech team. You can check the [current status of available seats](/smart-contract-seats.md). The private smart contract challenge repo and the related private Discord channel are only accessible by invitation after we have accepted the registration.

## Smart Contract Mission

### Registration

Registrations are now closed! Thanks to everyone who applied.

### Participation

- Join repository `Testnet4-SmartContractChallenges` and Discord channel `smart-contract-challenges`.
- Read our [documentation](https://developers.concordium.com/en/testnet4/smart-contracts/index.html).
- Develop, test and deploy your smart contract.
- Engage with us and other contributors in Discord.
- Have fun :sparkles:
- Submit in repo `Testnet4-SmartContractChallenges` (under license Apache 2.0).

### Changes along the way

- We'd prefer if you stayed with the smart contract that you specified in your registration. If you plan to change the category, send us an email to [testnet@concordium.com](mailto:testnet@concordium.com) and briefly explain your reasons. It is valuable feedback for us why and where you got stuck with your original contract.
- If you want to drop out without submitting, please let us know. We can then make your seat available to others.
- We are looking forward to engaging in direct communication and cooperation. But just for completeness, we reserve our right to withdraw acceptance and access of a contributor at any time, if e.g. language or attitude becomes offensive.
